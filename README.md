# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landings. By determining if a booster will land successfully, we can estimate the cost of a launch, providing valuable insights for competitors bidding against SpaceX. 

The project covers the full data science lifecycle: data collection, cleaning, exploratory analysis, interactive visualization, and machine learning.
